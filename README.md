# hello-world

This is a repository that I create following the GitHub Guide :"Hello World" as probably hundreds of other people have done before me.

Yay ! no, just kiding. I just keep going trough the "tutorial" and it make a lot of sens to me so I think it is great... I'm a blender user... not really active but still. I have to quickly finisht this because I have to go cook some potatoes that I will eat with some leftover food... yeah... I know it's sad but it is okey :)
